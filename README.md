## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to be able to display UFO sightings around the world in an easy to parse webpage, including the ability to filter the data for a more straightforward understanding.

## Results
The site is intended to  provide the ability to review all available data on UFO sightings.  Simply from loading the page, you will have access to all the data.  In addition, you may wish to filter the data for your convenience.

### Filtering
The filters for the data are on the left side of the website.  You may filter by city, state, country, and date.  Filtering occurs automatically upon entering the correctly formatted filter, which is previewed within the filter

## Summary
One drawback of this design is that I believe the lack of a button makes this less intuitive, it really does require explicity instructions on how the filter works.  In the future I would either bring the button back or include the instructions on the website.  In addition, I would find some way to filter keywords in the description, since that is some of the most interesting information!
